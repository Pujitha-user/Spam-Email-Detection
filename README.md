# Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Spam Email Classifier** using Python and machine learning techniques. The classifier can identify whether a given email message is **spam** or **not spam (ham)** based on its content.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify email messages. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and applies machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

---

##  Features

- Load and explore the dataset
- Clean and preprocess text data
- Transform text into numerical format using TF-IDF
- Train multiple ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Predict on new email samples

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib / seaborn
  - sklearn (Scikit-learn)
  - nltk (for text processing)
  - wordcloud (for visualizing frequent words)

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used is a public SMS spam collection, commonly containing labeled messages as either:
- `ham` – legitimate email
- `spam` – unwanted or phishing message

You can find similar datasets on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open `spammail.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab
2. Run each cell step-by-step
3. Train your model and evaluate performance
4. Input your own email text to test predictions

---

##  Model Performance

The notebook includes evaluation metrics like:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

##  Future Improvements

- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
- Add GUI for user input
- Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM) for better accuracy
- Enable live email filtering via IMAP/SMTP
